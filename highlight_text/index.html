          Anna Metselitsa is the 30-year-old female founder of Haute Rogue,
          which is an online boutique with a large following and designs sold in
          exclusive and renowned stores. This would be quite an achievement for
          any business owner, but it is a great success for an immigrant
          entrepreneur who came to the United States with just $300 in her
          pocket. She left Belarus for America in the year 2007, ultimately
          finding her way to New York City. For about 7 years, she waitressed
          and had many jobs in order to survive and save for her dream of
          becoming a fashion designer. Her dream came true in May 2014, when she
          launched her online shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metselitsa did not have an easy childhood as her family lived off
          government assistance and purchased only the bare necessities. What
          kept her going was her passion for clothing, cultivated early on
          through fashion magazines, which she bought whenever she could and
          which inspired her to find low-cost ways to look good, even if her
          creations did not last long. Likewise, she also found low-cost ways to
          look good even if her creations did not last long.
        </p>
        <p>
          After moving to New York, she taught herself website design and coding
          using online resources and initially sold clothing made by other
          designers, while she worked on designs for dresses and shirts. Saying
          she struggled at the beginning would be an understatement. Sleeping on
          a warehouse floor by night and eating cheap fast food by day,
          Nevertheless, Haute Rogue grew. Haute Rogue now sells products through
          more than 800 stores across North America, and she now plans to expand
          into other continents.
        </p>
        <p>
          For two years, she experienced some complications in keeping her
          business afloat, specifically with reinvesting her income she made
          from the business. She also began to sell her own colorful designs to
          numerous small New York boutiques. By 2016, everything was looking up,
          with the business receiving its first big order from the fashion giant
          Forever 21.
        </p>
        <p>
          Partnering with a friend from the wholesale sector, she was able to
          keep Haute Rogue on budget and has, since then, seen it grow with each
          passing year. Today, its clothing is sold in stores in the U.S.,
          Canada and Mexico, while the company’s online presence now includes
          more than 77,000 followers on Instagram and 15,000 on Facebook.
          Whatever the future holds, Metselitsa still has big dreams for new
          opportunities.
